Chaincode Chaincode is software that encapsulates the business logic and transactioninstructions for creating and modifying assets in the ledger. Chaincode can be written in different languages, and Hyperledger Platform supports: Go and Node.js Chaincode

A Chaincode runs in a docker container that is associated with any peer that needs to interact with it.  Chaincode is installed on a peer, then instantiated on a channel. All members that want to submit transactions or read data by using a Chaincode need to install the Chaincode on their peer

 IMPORTANT: A Chaincode is defined by its name and version. Both the name and version of the installed Chaincode need to be consistent across the peers on a channel.

After Chaincode is installed on the peers, a single network member instantiates the Chaincode on the channel. The network member needs to have joined the channel in order to perform this action


If a peer with a Chaincode installed joins a channel where it has already been instantiated, the Chaincode container will start automatically


The combination of installation and instantiation is a powerful feature because it allows for a peer to use a single Chaincode across many channels.

Peers may want to join multiple channels that use the same Chaincode, but with different sets of network members able to access the data.

A peer can the install the Chaincode once, and then use the same Chaincode container on any channel where it has been instantiated

Let's Start - 

Shutdown all docker containers   

docker stop $(docker ps -aq) 

docker rm $(docker ps -aq) 

cd  

git clone https://github.com/hlf-admin/basic-network.git

git clone https://github.com/hlf-admin/install-chaincode.git 


cd $HOME/install-chaincode/basic-network

sudo ./start.sh 

Verify docker containers

sudo docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Networks}}"


Step #2: Install & Instantiate Chaincode Let’s step into the peer container to deploy chaincode. Open terminal window and enter following commands

sudo docker exec -it cli bash

We need to set appropriate environmental variables so that the PEER is able to use the correct crypto materials   

$: export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin\@org1.example.com/msp 

$: export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 

$: export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=Org1MSP

Define the channel name, in our case ‘mychannel’   $: export CHANNEL_NAME=mychannel

Now let’s create a new directory and cd into it where we will download a sample Chaincode

mkdir chain

cd chain

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/release-1.4/chaincode/chaincode_example02/node/chaincode_example02.js  

$: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/release-1.4/chaincode/chaincode_example02/node/package.json


Let’s look at the chaincode details   $: cat package.json


Using the name and version let’s install the chaincode

cd ..

sudo docker exec -it cli bash

peer chaincode install -n example02 -v 1.0.0 -l node -p chain3/

exit 

sudo docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Networks}}"


sudo ./stop.sh 


Excercise is to Query this Chain Code 


==============================================

Upgrade the Chaincode 

Start the First Network 

docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}\t{{.Networks}}"


export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org1.example.com/users/Admin\@org1.example.com/msp 
$: export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org1.example.com:7051 

Define the channel name, in our case ‘mychannel’   $: export CHANNEL_NAME=mychannel 



mkdir chain2 $: cd chain2 Download the chaincode & package.json here  

$: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/release-1.4/chaincode/chaincode_example02/node/chaincode_example02.js 

$: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/release-1.4/chaincode/chaincode_example02/node/package.json



$: apt-get update 

$: apt-get install vim 

$: vi package.json

I for insert Mode 

Change Version from 1 to 2  

peer chaincode install -n example -v 2.0.0 -l node -p chain2/

peer chaincode upgrade -o orderer.example.com:7050 -C

==============================================

Installing Chain Code to Multiple Peers 


Come back to Home cd 

Clone Multi Organisation Chaincode Repo 

git clone https://github.com/hlf-admin/chaincode-multi-org.git


Stop docker containers and remove  thems

docker stop $(docker ps -aq) 

$: docker rm $(docker ps -aq)


cd chaincode* 

cd modified* 

./start.sh
